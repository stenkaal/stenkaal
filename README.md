## Welcome!

My name is Sten and am a certified upper secondary engineer ([Gymnasieingej√∂r](https://utbildningsguiden.skolverket.se/gymnasieskolan/gymnasieskolans-program/gymnasieingenjor)). This means that I have qualifications in things like plan, carry out and assess an IT project, communicate technology and technical solutions and much more. 

This page is ment to present my projects that I am working on, aswell as show how I made them and show my programming skills.
