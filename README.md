## Welcome!👋

My name is Sten and am a certified upper secondary engineer👷‍♂️ ([Gymnasieingejör](https://utbildningsguiden.skolverket.se/gymnasieskolan/gymnasieskolans-program/gymnasieingenjor)). This means that I have qualifications in planning, carrying out and assessing IT projects💻, ability to communicate technology and technical solutions, among other things. 

This page is ment to present my projects that I am working on, aswell as show how I made them and to show my programming skills.
